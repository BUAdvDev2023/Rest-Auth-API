# Rest-Auth-API

This module introduces comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user authentication in the RESTful API. The goal is to enhance the authentication system by allowing users to manage their accounts through standard HTTP methods.

Implementing the /api/users endpoint for creating new user accounts using a POST request.
Added /api/login endpoint for user authentication through a POST request.
Introduced /api/users/<int:id> endpoint to retrieve user details using a GET request.
Created a /api/users/<int:id> endpoint for updating user information via a PUT request.
Implemented a /api/users/<int:id> endpoint for deleting user accounts using a DELETE request.

Additional Notes:

The codebase has been thoroughly tested, and all tests pass successfully.
This feature aligns with any project authentication design and enhances the overall user experience.
